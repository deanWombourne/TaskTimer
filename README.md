# TaskTimer

##Â In progress

+ Create new task scene

## Architectures

+ Command - I'm liking deferring completion, but I'm still not 100% sure it's saving me very much yet

+ Abstracting CoreData behind structs 
    - Attempting to make CoreData only a storage layer. I don't like the way CoreData seems to permeate through any app it's in, and I'd like to see if/how that can be avoided
    - loving the cleaness and Swiftyness of the model interface, but still not as seamless as I'd like


## Libraries

+ CoreStore instead of MagicalRecord - liking it so far, but still getting used to it
+ Eureka - seems to make some bits much much simpler, at the cost of learning it.
